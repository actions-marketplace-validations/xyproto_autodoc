# autodoc

A GitHub action for automatically generating API documentation and checking in the resulting Markdown file into the `github-pages` directory, using LLMs (Large Language Models) running locally within the GitHub action.

Currently only small projects written in Go are supported.

Take a look at https://github.com/xyproto/vegetables for example use.
